    <h2>PCAU and PGWA are officially going to merge under a new name, the Postgraduate Workers Organisation (PWO).</h2>
    <p>January 31st, 2023<br>
        We are pleased to announce that today we are officially opening formal membership of this new union to all postgraduate researchers in Ireland. Being a member of PWO means that you will be part of an organisation that will pursue constructive action to reform the provision of postgraduate research in Ireland. Like groups such as the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO), we envisage membership of the union to be an integral part of being a postgraduate researcher in Ireland: a formalised, active union that ensures a decent standard of living for all of its members, both now and into the future.
        You can fill out the form below to officially become a member. In the coming week, you will get a welcome email with information about the union and our next action. You will also have the opportunity to provide additional information about your current situation that will help us better represent the current state of affairs to policymakers and the media.

    <h2>The Fair Researcher Agreement (FRA)</h2>
    <p>December 6th, 2022<br>
        The PCAU has submitted the "Fair Postgraduate Researcher Agreement" (FRA) outlining a full set of demands for reforms to PhD research to the Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris. The document is fully supported by PGWA, the Postgraduate Researchers’ Alliance, and is made as a set of demands to be considered both by Harris, his PhD review board, and the Co-Chairs appointed to the board. 
        The FRA is the result of months of engagement with our members from across the country, a process which delivered a clear and consistent message - PhD researchers in Ireland are struggling to survive on stipends that are never higher than thirty percent below the minimum wage, have no access to basic employment rights such as sick or paternal leave, and work within a system that actively discriminates against non-EU researchers in terms of remuneration and residency.
        The FRA is supported and endorsed by all major representative bodies of students and several local SUs across the universities of Ireland, including the TU Dublin Students Union, the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), University College Dublin Student Union (UCDSU), University of Galway Student Union and Trinity College Dublin Student Union (TCDSU).
